# Phase 4.1: Reviews and Wishlist - Progress Report

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the wishlist functionality for the VowSwapping platform. This feature allows users to save products they're interested in for later consideration, enhancing the shopping experience and potentially increasing conversion rates.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Wishlist Functionality

- **Database Schema**:
  - Added Wishlist model to Prisma schema with appropriate relations to User and Product models
  - Created migration file for the Wishlist table

- **State Management**:
  - Implemented Zustand store for client-side wishlist management
  - Added persistence using localStorage to maintain wishlist across sessions
  - Created functions for adding, removing, and checking items in the wishlist

- **UI Components**:
  - Created WishlistButton component for adding/removing products from wishlist
  - Integrated wishlist button into ProductCard component
  - Added wishlist button to product detail pages
  - Implemented wishlist page at `/profile/wishlist` for viewing and managing saved items
  - Added wishlist count indicator in the user dropdown menu

- **API Endpoints**:
  - Created `/api/user/wishlist` endpoint for getting and adding wishlist items
  - Implemented `/api/user/wishlist/[productId]` endpoint for removing items from wishlist
  - Added authentication checks to ensure only logged-in users can manage their wishlist

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The wishlist functionality is currently implemented primarily using client-side state management with Zustand.
- API endpoints have been created with the correct structure, but they currently serve as placeholders that will be fully implemented once the database migration is successfully applied.
- The Wishlist model has been added to the Prisma schema, but the migration needs to be applied to the production database.

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Migration

- Apply the Wishlist model migration to the production database
- Update API endpoints to use Prisma for database persistence instead of relying on client-side state

### 2. Reviews System

- Implement product and seller reviews functionality:
  - Create UI components for displaying and submitting reviews
  - Implement API endpoints for review management
  - Add validation to ensure only verified purchasers can leave reviews
  - Update product and seller pages to display reviews and ratings

### 3. Testing and Refinement

- Test wishlist functionality across different devices and browsers
- Ensure proper error handling for edge cases
- Optimize performance for users with large wishlists

## Conclusion

The wishlist functionality provides a solid foundation for enhancing user engagement on the VowSwapping platform. Once the database migration is applied and the reviews system is implemented, Phase 4.1 will be complete, setting the stage for the advanced search and recommendation features planned for Phase 4.2.
