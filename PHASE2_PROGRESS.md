# Phase 2 Progress: Database-Backed Product Management

## Completed Tasks

### Week 1: Database Standardization & Deployment Foundation

- ✅ Standardized database access with Prisma ORM
  - Refactored `/api/products/route.ts` to use Prisma instead of direct PostgreSQL queries
  - Refactored `/api/products/[id]/route.ts` to use Prisma for consistent data access
  - Removed direct PostgreSQL connection pool in favor of Prisma client

- ✅ Set up Cloudinary integration for image uploads
  - Created `src/lib/cloudinary.ts` utility for image upload, deletion, and optimization
  - Implemented `/api/upload/route.ts` endpoint for secure image uploads
  - Added helper functions for image optimization

### Week 2: Admin Interface & Product Management

- ✅ Created admin dashboard
  - Implemented main admin dashboard at `/admin/page.tsx`
  - Added authentication checks to restrict access to authenticated users
  - Created product management interface at `/admin/products/page.tsx`

- ✅ Implemented product creation and editing
  - Created product creation form with image upload at `/admin/products/create/page.tsx`
  - Implemented product editing functionality at `/admin/products/edit/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Added image management with Cloudinary integration

- ✅ Updated navigation
  - Added admin dashboard link to the user dropdown menu in the navbar

## Next Steps

### Deployment to Vercel

1. Configure environment variables in Vercel:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Cloudinary cloud name
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Cloudinary API key
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Cloudinary API secret
   - Other existing environment variables (NextAuth, Stripe, etc.)

2. Update database schema if needed:
   - Ensure Prisma schema is up to date
   - Run migrations during deployment

3. Test deployment:
   - Verify product management functionality
   - Test image uploads
   - Ensure all API routes work correctly

### Week 3: Data Migration & UI Refinement

1. Create robust seed script:
   - Update `prisma/seed.ts` to include all mock products
   - Ensure it's idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)

2. Implement admin order management:
   - Create order listing page
   - Add order detail view
   - Implement order status updates

3. Enhance product display components:
   - Update `ProductCard.tsx` and `ProductGrid.tsx` to use optimized Cloudinary images
   - Improve product filtering and sorting

### Week 4: Final Optimizations

1. Add caching strategies:
   - Implement caching for product data
   - Optimize API routes for serverless performance

2. Implement seller-specific views:
   - Add seller filtering to product management
   - Prepare for marketplace functionality in Phase 3

3. Complete documentation:
   - Update deployment guides
   - Document admin functionality
