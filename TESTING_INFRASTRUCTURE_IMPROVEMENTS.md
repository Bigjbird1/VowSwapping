# VowSwapping Testing Infrastructure Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the VowSwapping testing infrastructure to address the connection pooling issues and other test failures.

## Problem Overview

The original testing infrastructure had several issues:

1. **Connection Pooling Conflicts**: The error "ERROR: prepared statement 's1' already exists" indicated that multiple database connections were trying to use the same prepared statement names, causing conflicts.

2. **Schema Isolation**: Tests were not properly isolated, leading to potential data contamination between test runs.

3. **Resource Cleanup**: Resources (database connections, schemas, etc.) were not being properly cleaned up after tests, leading to resource leaks.

4. **Error Handling**: Error handling was insufficient, making it difficult to diagnose and fix issues.

## Solution Approach

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to address these issues:

### 1. Enhanced Database Connection Handling

- **Unique Session IDs**: Each test run now generates a unique session ID to avoid conflicts.
- **Unique Schema Names**: Each test run uses a unique database schema, ensuring complete isolation.
- **Connection Pooling Parameters**: Added parameters to the database connection URL to prevent prepared statement conflicts:
  - `application_name`: Set to a unique value for each test run
  - `statement_cache_size`: Set to 0 to disable statement caching
  - `pool_timeout`: Set to a reasonable value to prevent hanging connections

### 2. Improved Test Setup and Teardown

- **Proper Schema Creation**: The test setup now properly creates and verifies the test schema.
- **Resource Cleanup**: The test teardown now properly cleans up all resources, including:
  - Disconnecting database connections
  - Dropping the test schema
  - Removing temporary files

### 3. Better Test Organization

- **Separated Test Suites**: Tests are now organized into smaller, more focused suites.
- **Isolated Test Environments**: Each test suite runs in its own isolated environment.
- **Improved Logging**: Better logging and reporting to help diagnose issues.

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- **Detailed Error Logging**: More detailed error logging to help diagnose issues.
- **Proper Error Propagation**: Errors are now properly propagated and handled.
- **Cleanup on Error**: Resources are properly cleaned up even when errors occur.

## Implementation Details

### New Files

1. **test-connection-fix.js**: A standalone script to test database connections with improved connection pooling.
2. **__tests__/database/improved-db-setup.js**: An improved database setup module for Jest tests.
3. **run-improved-db-tests.sh**: A script to run database tests with the improved setup.
4. **run-improved-api-tests.sh**: A script to run API tests with the improved setup.
5. **run-improved-tests.sh**: A script to run all tests with the improved setup.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Unique Schema Names

Each test run now uses a unique schema name based on the current timestamp and a random string:

```javascript
const sessionId = `test_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 10)}`;
const schemaName = `test_${sessionId}`;
```

#### 2. Connection Pooling Parameters

The database connection URL now includes parameters to prevent prepared statement conflicts:

```javascript
searchParams.set('application_name', `vowswap_test_${sessionId}`);
searchParams.set('statement_cache_size', '0');
searchParams.set('pool_timeout', '30');
```

#### 3. Proper Schema Creation and Cleanup

The test setup now properly creates and verifies the test schema:

```javascript
// Drop schema if it exists
await client.query(`DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS ${schemaName} CASCADE`);

// Create schema
await client.query(`CREATE SCHEMA ${schemaName}`);

// Set search path
await client.query(`SET search_path TO ${schemaName}`);

// Verify schema was created
const result = await client.query(`
  SELECT schema_name 
  FROM information_schema.schemata 
  WHERE schema_name = $1
`, [schemaName]);
```

And the test teardown properly cleans up:

```javascript
// Drop the test schema
await client.query(`DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS ${schemaName} CASCADE`);

// Remove temporary .env.test file
if (fs.existsSync(envTestPath)) {
  fs.unlinkSync(envTestPath);
}
```

#### 4. Improved Test Scripts

The test scripts now run tests in a more organized and isolated manner:

```bash
# Run the test with improved database setup
npx jest ${test_path} \
  --runInBand \
  --detectOpenHandles \
  --forceExit \
  --testTimeout=30000 \
  --setupFilesAfterEnv=./__tests__/database/improved-db-setup.js > ${output_file} 2>&1
```

## How to Use

### Running Database Tests

```bash
./run-improved-db-tests.sh
```

### Running API Tests

```bash
./run-improved-api-tests.sh
```

### Running All Tests

```bash
./run-improved-tests.sh
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Test Parallelization**: Once the connection pooling issues are fully resolved, we can explore running tests in parallel to improve performance.

2. **Database Mocking**: For certain tests, we could use database mocking to avoid the overhead of real database connections.

3. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate the improved testing infrastructure with CI/CD pipelines.

4. **Test Coverage Analysis**: Add test coverage analysis to identify areas that need more testing.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring to identify slow tests and optimize them.

## Conclusion

These improvements address the connection pooling issues and other test failures in the VowSwapping testing infrastructure. By using unique schema names, proper connection pooling parameters, and better resource cleanup, we've created a more robust and reliable testing environment.
