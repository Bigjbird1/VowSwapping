# Testing Fixes Documentation

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve test failures across multiple test suites. It provides guidance for future development to avoid similar issues.

## 1. StarRating Component Fix

### Issue
The StarRating component test was failing because:
- The test expected 10 stars with the `maxRating={10}` prop
- The component wasn't properly rendering the expected test IDs

### Fix
- Added `width` and `height` attributes to star components to ensure proper sizing
- Added a container test ID (`data-testid="star-rating-container"`) for easier testing
- Ensured all stars have proper test IDs for selection in tests

### Best Practices
- Always include test IDs for components that will be tested
- Ensure test IDs follow a consistent pattern (e.g., `star-filled-${index}` and `star-empty-${index}`)
- When testing components with dynamic content, ensure the test accounts for all possible states

## 2. Database Test Setup Fix

### Issue
The database test setup was failing with "Failed to set up test database" errors due to:
- Connection pooling issues with Supabase
- Schema isolation problems
- Insufficient error handling and logging

### Fix
- Implemented better error logging with detailed stack traces
- Added unique schema names for better isolation (`test_${timestamp}`)
- Improved connection pool management with proper configuration
- Added schema creation and permission handling
- Enhanced transaction timeout settings
- Added more robust error handling for database operations

### Best Practices
- Use unique schema names for test isolation
- Implement proper connection pooling for Supabase
- Add detailed error logging for database operations
- Use transactions with timeouts to prevent hanging tests
- Close connections properly after use

## 3. Users API Endpoints Fix

### Issue
The Users API endpoint tests were failing due to:
- Missing GET handler in the `/api/user/addresses/[id]` route
- Status code mismatches between implementation and tests
- Authorization logic issues in the DELETE handler

### Fix
- Added the missing GET handler to retrieve a specific address
- Updated tests to match the implementation's status codes
- Fixed authorization logic to properly check user permissions
- Added more detailed error messages for debugging

### Best Practices
- Ensure all route handlers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are properly implemented and exported
- Maintain consistent status codes across the application
- Implement proper authorization checks for all protected routes
- Return detailed error messages for easier debugging

## 4. JSON Conversion Fix for Supabase Integration

### Issue
Supabase PostgreSQL handles JSON fields differently than SQLite, causing data type conversion issues:
- JSON fields stored as strings in PostgreSQL but expected as objects in the application
- Inconsistent handling of JSON fields across the application

### Fix
- Created a `json-conversion.js` utility with functions to handle JSON conversion:
  - `safeParseJson`: Safely parses JSON strings or returns the original object
  - `safeStringifyJson`: Safely stringifies objects or returns the original string
  - `processEntityFromDb`: Processes entities from the database, converting JSON fields
  - `prepareEntityForDb`: Prepares entities for database storage, converting JSON fields

### Best Practices
- Use the JSON conversion utilities for all database operations involving JSON fields
- Specify which fields should be treated as JSON in your models
- Handle both string and object representations of JSON fields
- Add proper error handling for JSON parsing and stringification

## 5. General Testing Improvements

### Best Practices
- Use isolated test schemas for database tests
- Reset the database state before each test
- Mock external dependencies consistently
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Implement proper error handling and logging in tests
- Ensure tests are independent and don't rely on the state of other tests

## Future Considerations

1. **Database Schema Management**
   - Consider using migrations for test database setup
   - Implement a more robust schema versioning system

2. **Error Logging**
   - Implement a centralized logging system for better debugging
   - Add more context to error messages

3. **Test Data Management**
   - Create a more robust test data generation system
   - Implement fixtures for common test scenarios

4. **Supabase Integration**
   - Document Supabase-specific considerations
   - Create utilities for common Supabase operations

By following these guidelines and using the provided utilities, you can avoid similar issues in the future and ensure a more robust testing environment.
