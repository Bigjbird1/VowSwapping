# Deployment Fix Guide

This document explains the changes made to fix the deployment issues with the VowSwapping application on Vercel.

## Issue

The deployment was failing with the error:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'date-fns'
```

This was happening despite the date-fns package being listed in the package.json dependencies. The issue was related to a mismatch between the package.json and package-lock.json files.

## Changes Made

After analyzing the error logs, we identified that Vercel was trying to use `npm ci` for installation, which requires the package.json and package-lock.json files to be in sync. The error specifically mentioned:

```
npm error Invalid: lock file's date-fns@4.1.0 does not satisfy date-fns@2.30.0
```

To fix this issue, we:

1. **Reverted date-fns version**: Changed the version back to `^4.1.0` in package.json to match what's in the package-lock.json file.

2. **Simplified the configuration**: Removed unnecessary configuration files (.npmrc, .nvmrc, etc.) that might have been interfering with the build process.

3. **Ensured vercel.json is properly configured**: Verified that the vercel.json file has the correct installation command.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit and push all changes** to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues with date-fns"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel** using your preferred method (GitHub integration, Vercel CLI, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. **Check the Vercel build logs** for specific error messages.

2. **Verify environment variables** are properly set in the Vercel dashboard.

3. **Consider manually clearing the Vercel build cache** from the Vercel dashboard if issues persist.

4. **If you need to update dependencies** in the future, make sure to update both package.json and package-lock.json together by running `npm install` locally after making changes to package.json.
